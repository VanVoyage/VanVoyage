          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>The campaign presented was about showing and executing ideas to the public on what our event Van Voyage was all about. Like the event, we wanted to evoke the emotion of creating new experiences while meeting new people. We created both Facebook and Instagram to reach our target audience.</p>
          <p>The objectives are the following:</p>
			<p><strong>Reach</strong></p>
			<p>We are entering the market as the first official campervan convention in Europe. For our marketing campaign we looked at what other European conventions did on social media. With a sample size of 5 accounts, we found that for Instagram these companies have an average of 22.4k followers with the largest amount being around 43.4k and the lowest amount being around 1.1k. </p>
			<p>Each post has an average of around 415 likes per post with the largest amount being around 1.1k and the lowest amount being around 52. Each post has an average of 15.6 comments with the largest amount being around 31 and the lowest amount being around 1. Each post has an average of 3 shares with the largest amount being around 8 and the lowest amount being around 0. </p>
		  <p>Each post has an average of around 86 likes with the largest amount being around 300 and the lowest amount being around 22. Each post has an average of 13.2 comments with the largest amount being around 50 and the lowest amount being around 3. Each post has an average of around 8 shares with the largest amount being 15 and lowest amount being 3.</p>
			<p>Instagram Reach Justification (Likes comments and shares are estimates calculated by the last 30 posts)</p>
		  <img src="images/justification2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
			<li>
			<p>Obviously, we’re a new company so we have decided not to set extremely high goals yet. We want to start by aiming for at least 80 followers on our Instagram account. Furthermore, we hope that every post gets at least 1 comment, at least 1 share and around 20 likes. These numbers seem reasonable in comparison to the results shown in the table above. We want to achieve these goals by the 31st of May.</p></li>
		  <p><strong>Affect</strong></p>
			<p>After watching our social media page, our target audience should feel excited and want to join the vibrant community of Van Voyage and not want to miss a single post from our social media.</p>
			<p><strong>Response</strong></p>	  	
			<p>We want our target audience to click the link in our bio and visit our website to where they can buy tickets for the event. We also have plans for various collaborations with companies and people like travel influencers for giveaways to further give our target audience more incentive to visit our website.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>For the social media planning, we decided to research what the best time and day is to post on Facebook and Instagram. We discovered that statistically between 4-5 pm the most amount of people is online specifically on Wednesdays and Thursdays, but after posting for 2 weeks the Meta business page recommended us to post on Mondays and Tuesdays around 8 pm. This was because Meta noticed that most of our followers were online at these specific times. What did not go so well was the fact that we had no engagement on our Facebook page. Joining camper van users Facebook groups would have been a better option to allow people to see our page. We have learned that although Facebook is a platform that camper van users use a lot, maybe considering newer platforms like TikTok would also be a nice choice because many people of all ages are now familiar with TikTok whether they have the app or not.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>We really do believe that having a TikTok page would attract a greater audience and possibly send viewers to our Facebook page as well. If the campaign continues, we will result in more offline promotions and speak to more campervan users. This way word of mouth would spread faster and create awareness of who we are as a brand. Implementing local campervan users as the face of our campaigns would be a great initiative with videos of people speaking and explaining the event rather than a picture with a caption and music over it. Pertaining to the assignment itself, we believe that increasing the number of posts we post per week would be beneficial to have a better overview of our campaign. As well as including more interactive stories as well. In addition to that, we would decrease our objectives for likes and followers to lower our expectations.</p>
