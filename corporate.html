          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>The campaign presented was about showing and executing ideas to the public on what our event Van Voyage was all about. Like the event, we wanted to evoke the emotion of creating new experiences while meeting new people. We created both Facebook and Instagram to reach our target audience.</p>
          <p>The objectives are the following:</p>
			<p><strong>Reach</strong></p>
			<p>- For our marketing campaign we looked at what other travel agencies did on social media. Most of these companies get around 200 to 600 likes on each post and have around 1500 followers on their accounts. We also looked at a travel company that was smaller who had around 1000 followers. Their post would get around 10 likes for each post.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>- We aim to get 100 followers on our Instagram account by the 31st of March. We are smaller than the other accounts, so it'll take a bit longer to gain followers.&nbsp; </p>
		  <p>-&nbsp;Furthermore, we hope that every post gets at least 1 comment for engagement with our target audience.</p>
			<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;And by March 31st we want our posts to have around 50 likes. Based on what we saw was that the higher likes were for the bigger companies but smaller companies only a handful. Therefore, we thought it was safe to sit in the middle with likes for our social media campaign.</p>
			<p><strong>Affect</strong></p>
			<p>- After watching our social media page our target audience should feel excited to join the vibrant community of Van Voyage. They are going to be happy with a slight hint of relief that they now can be part of a community.</p>
			<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
			<p>- We want our target audience to click the link in our bio that'll lead them to the website where they can buy tickets for the event. </p>
	  	  <p>- Furthermore, we want to work together with travel influencers for giveaways. So, for the giveaways, we want our reels to get at least 20 shares. </p>
			<p>After doing research we found that Instagram and Facebook are social media pages our target audiences use the most; our target audience generation are mainly millennials. The top 3 social media platforms for millennials are Facebook (87%), Instagram (72%), and YouTube (66%). Facebook is used by a lot of camper van users for the groups feature on the app. They use the groups to connect with each other. Instagram is used by camper van users to observe the aesthetic lifestyle of a camper van user. They share travelling videos and pictures.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>For the social media planning, we decided to research what the best time and day is to post on Facebook and Instagram. We discovered that statistically between 4-5 pm the most amount of people is online specifically on Wednesdays and Thursdays, but after posting for 2 weeks the Meta business page recommended us to post on Mondays and Tuesdays around 8 pm. This was because Meta noticed that most of our followers were online at these specific times. What did not go so well was the fact that we had no engagement on our Facebook page. Joining camper van users Facebook groups would have been a better option to allow people to see our page. We have learned that although Facebook is a platform that camper van users use a lot, maybe considering newer platforms like TikTok would also be a nice choice because many people of all ages are now familiar with TikTok whether they have the app or not.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>We really do believe that having a TikTok page would attract a greater audience and possibly send viewers to our Facebook page as well. If the campaign continues, we will result in more offline promotions and speak to more campervan users. This way word of mouth would spread faster and create awareness of who we are as a brand. Implementing local campervan users as the face of our campaigns would be a great initiative with videos of people speaking and explaining the event rather than a picture with a caption and music over it. Pertaining to the assignment itself, we believe that increasing the number of posts we post per week would be beneficial to have a better overview of our campaign. As well as including more interactive stories as well. In addition to that, we would decrease our objectives for likes and followers to lower our expectations.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The top 3 problems in our target audience are the loneliness on the road, the fact that a lot of people can't find a buddy on the road, and it is difficult finding like-minded people.</li>
            <li>Through our event, people can find other like-minded individuals with who they can travel with on vacation. Through the forum page on our website, they can also very easily get in contact with these people if they end up with questions after the event that Van Voyage organizes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vanvoyage creates an event where campervan lovers can come together and meet up. This is an annual event that is hosted in a different country each year. At this event, there are a lot of opportunities to come together and meet new people. There are workshops, competitions, food and drink stalls, meeting places, kid's playgrounds and even indoor wall-climbing facilities. And on top of that we even have our online community forum on our website, so that people can even meet up outside of our event.  
            <p>This event tackles the problem of people not finding like-minded people to connect with. The forum itself tackles all these problems, by offering people a medium to post requests looking for a travel buddy. But the forum can also be used for travel tips, and advice, or just use it as a communication medium to make new friends.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Families, younger couples, travel lovers, people who prefer to travel on a budget and glampers </li>
            <li> Because of the broad target audience, we have three brand personas. These are:
              <p>
              Vantoni is a full-time content creator that loves adventure! Her catchphrase is "Jobs fill your pocket, but adventures fill your soul." She regularly rents a campervan a few times a year to explore different parts of Europe. However, even though she enjoys the campervan style of travel, she really wants a fun way to meet other campervan users.  
              </p> 
              <p> 
                Van'ryce is an engineer that loves camping! He built his own campervan and uses it to travel. His spouse isn’t a fan of campervans though so van’ryce mostly travels alone. He loves his spouse, but he really wants to find some van friends to travel around with.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Vamie is a flight attendant that loves travelling! Even though she spends most of her time in the air, she adores the feeling of the road. Her spouse and their children love spending their summer travelling in a campervan, but they really want to meet other campervan families. 
              </P>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vanvoyage is an exciting community event where camper van enthusiasts of all ages come together to learn, compete, and most importantly make lifelong connections. With workshops, competitions, and family-friendly activities, Vanvoyage offers an impactful experience that celebrates the spirit of traveling and adventure.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Because Vanvoyage is the only event that caters to campervan travelers and adventurers, we already have a big advantage regarding interest. So, with that, we can make strategic partnerships with high-end brands in the travel industry, and they could offer us resources, sponsorships and promotions. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Because Vanvoyage is the first event of the sort among campervan users, we are going to be the main base for the people to meet up and form a community. This way we are the foundation of the community, and then more and more people will join this exciting event. As the community grows even bigger, we eventually will be a staple brand in the campervan community.  
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>

            <li>For Vanvoyage we are using social media and our website to communicate with our target audience. These channels are direct and our own. Since we are renting a pretty popular venue, we can reach out to an even bigger audience than we can ourselves. This venue is also in contact with our target audience through emails and advertisements. These emails and advertisements are examples of partnered direct channels and the advertisements are an example of a partnered indirect channel. </li>
            <li>Awareness: We are going to raise awareness about our company by having advertisements throughout the country where we are organizing the event. But the most attention we are aiming to get is through paid advertising on social media. So, the algorithm can target campervan users throughout Europe. 
            </li>
            <li>Evaluation: So, after people become aware of our specific event, we are going to direct them toward our social media and website. Here the target audience can experience what we stand for and read and see our values.  
            </li>
            <li>Purchase: In these advertisements, we would invite the target audience to “Buy tickets now on our website!” with a QR code that directs the target audience to our ticket sale page on our website. People also can visit the ticket sale page by clicking on the button when visiting the website themselves.  
            </li> 
            <li>Delivery: By wisely posting on our social media pages, we can show and convince our target audience that Vanvoyage is the only event made by and for campervan users.  
            </li>
            <li>Sales: After the customer has purchased a ticket for the event, they can ask questions by either filling out a customer question form or by giving us a call. The customer will always be held up to date by the emails we are sending them. </li>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tickets, with tickets we measure how many people come to our events.</li>
            <li>Activity involvement, by measuring the number of signups for the activities we can see what the people are into or not. This way we know what people like for future events. </li>
            <li>Social media engagement, with the analytics that we get from our social media pages and pad advertisements we can see how much traction our event gets online and how many people interact with our links and posts. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>One of the most obvious ways we get revenue during our event is ticket sales. While looking at the ticket prices of events that are like ours but address a different target audience, we can use similar rates. Looking at, for example, the Huishoudbeurs or Vakantiebeurs their tickets are priced in a range between 14-19 euros (Huishoudbeurs, 2024). So, if we stay within a similar range our tickets are being sold for 15,49 per ticket. Then we are going to look at how many tickets we are going to sell for our event and look at how Vakantiebeurs had around 71.000 visitors last year (Vakantiebeurs, 2024). Of course, we are not as big as the Vakantiebeurs, but we have the unfair advantage that we’re the only event like this, so we’re aiming lower but not by a lot. We are aiming for around 61.000 tickets sold so that means a ticket revenue of 61.000 x 15,49 = €944.890, -  </li>
            <li>The second way we get revenue is out of the vendor spots we sell. At our event, we will make room for a lot of external companies that want to directly reach out to their target audience. Think of campervan sellers, tent sellers, food and drink stalls, traveling gear, etc. These companies are allowed to have their stand at our event for a little fee. When looking at the Huishoudbeurs they have an average price of 671 (Huishoudbeurs, 2024) Then we look at how many vendors we can expect. Vakantiebeurs last year had 1052 vendors, so if we take that number and of course put it down a little bit. So, let’s say 600 vendors. We calculate a vendor fee of 600 x 671 = €402.600, -   </li>
            <li>Finally, we have workshops. We have different kinds of them and on average they will cost about €60, - per ticket. Each workshop will last 1,5 hour and then the people who give the workshop have a 30-minute break. So, each workshop lasts 2 hours. The event lasts for 8 hours so there can be 4 workshops held per kind. 4 x 3 = 12 workshops a day. Since our event lasts for 5 days we can have 60 workshops in total. There will be around 200 spots per workshop. So, in the end we can sell 12.000 workshop tickets. So, we get a revenue of workshop ticket sales: 12.000 x 60 = €720.000, - </li>
            <li>Our estimated revenue for our first year will then be 402.600 + 944.890 + 720.000 = €2.067.490, -  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Of course, with an event we need a venue, when looking at the pricing of venues it differs for what kind of event you are planning to hold. Since venues always work with quotes it is very difficult to know how much money it’s going to cost to rent out a venue. But there’s a way we can calculate at least an estimate. By looking at the Ziggo dome for example, Ziggo dome has a venue that fits 17.000 people and is 180m2 in size (Ziggodome, 2024). Renting this venue costs €28.000, - including personnel (3FM, 2020). So, that means on average you pay €28.000 / 17.000 = €1,64 per person. Going by that rate and comparing that to our ticket sales we can estimate how much it’s going to cost us to rent out a venue that fits our capacity of around 61.000 visitors. So that means 61.000 x €1,64 = €100.040 per day. Our event lasts for 5 days, so that means 5 x €100.040 = €500.200, -  </li>
            <li>Then we also need a permit to organize the event. According to the municipality of Utrecht, permits are priced between €231, - and €6.000, - (Gemeente Utrecht, 2024). Assuming it’s a big event, but of course not a city-wide event, we’re aiming for around 5.000 a day. So, 5 x 5.000 = €25.000 in permit costs. </li>
            <li>Then we also have advertisement costs. We are focusing on advertising mostly online since with Instagram algorithms we can reach our target audience as effectively as possible. For Instagram we want to reach about 100.000 Instagram users, Instagram asks 6,18 per thousand reaches (Basque, 2024). So, 100.000/1000 = 100. 100 x 6,18 = €618, - for Instagram advertisement.  </li>
            <li>So, our cost structure is in total 500.200 + 25.000 + 618 = €525.818,- </li>  
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vanvoyage is a brand for all travelers and adventurers who are campervan lovers. Whether you’re the adventurer type, the glamper type, or the family type. Our brand is there to unite all different kinds of camper van users. To find any problem within the campervan community we conducted problem interviews. From these interviews, we found problems within the campervan community. These problems are: Not having a way to encounter other campervan lovers, campervan users feeling lonely when on the road, and there’s no specific way to find traveling buddies while on the road. To cater to these problems Vanvoyage created an event and an online forum where people can meet up with each other in real life or submit requests/give advice online during their travels on our online platform. During our event, Vanvoyage offers different types of entertainment that attract different kinds of campervan lovers. During the event our visitors can indoor wall climb, participate in competitions, do several workshops and there is a big area where kids can play as well. People can meet like-minded people during this event so they can make traveling buddies for life. And if people are on the road and are still looking for advice or traveling buddies, they can just make a post on our website. This way other people who can give advice or want to be their traveling buddy can just respond and tag along on the other person’s journey. This way we solve loneliness on the road of camper van users.  </li>
            <li>This event and forum fit our brand identity, because it ties perfectly with our brand vision. “At Van Voyage we believe that every van holds a story, and we want to create a place where people from different backgrounds and cultures across Europe come together to share their beautiful experiences.” </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>Before conducting interviews, we made a lean canvas (version 1) based on our assumptions and no research beforehand. In the building block “Problem” we assumed that the biggest problem of campervan users was going to be the costs of driving and owning a camper van. So, in the “Solution” building block we wrote down that Vanvoyage is going to offer a campervan rental service so that everyone can enjoy the pleasure of traveling with a campervan without any long-term costs. However, after conducting the problem interviews, we decided to have a Problem and a Solution pivot. Since we discovered that money is indeed a small issue since owning and traveling in a campervan can sometimes be very expensive. But people can get over that problem. The biggest problem that camper van users have currently is the feeling of loneliness of travel. </p>
          <p>The unique value proposition we had on our first lean canvas goes as follows: “Van Voyage brings the joy of traveling with a campervan to your doorstep in a very accessible way! Vanvoyage is there for people who don’t have a camper van because of budget or personal issues. Now with Vanvoyage, you can rent out one without thinking of wasting money!” However, after we conducted our problem interviews, we had to have a Problem and Solution pivot. And with those kinds of pivots, you also need to review and rework your unique value proposition. So, we decided we would have a unique value proposition pivot and change that into what we now have which goes as follows: “Vanvoyage is an exciting community event where camper van enthusiasts of all ages come together to learn, compete, and most importantly make lifelong connections. With workshops, competitions, and family-friendly activities, Vanvoyage offers an impactful experience that celebrates the spirit of traveling and adventure.” </p>
